## NON-EARTHLING NEWS

### If, for some reason, you feel the need to clutter your own computer with more code then you can run this with the following: 
- clone it
- cd into it
- pray I didn't take the proxy server down
- run it in your favorite way OR install lite-server and then run the command `lite-server` in the project

#### Get the latest news about our friends from outer space, sourced from all over the web. With easy sorting, filtering and searchability, you will be able to find all the latest alien information you desire.

#### Check the progress of this project via tasks here: [Project](https://github.com/CassandraGoose/non-earthling-news/projects/1)
